NASA APOD Birthday Viewer
This Python script fetches and displays NASAâ€™s Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) for a userâ€™s birthday (or any date after June 16, 1995). It interacts with NASAâ€™s public APOD API to retrieve the picture, title, explanation, and media link.
Features
â€¢	Prompts the user for their birthday in YYYY-MM-DD format

â€¢	Validates the date format and ensures itâ€™s not earlier than June 16, 1995

â€¢	Retrieves APOD data (image or video) from NASAâ€™s API

â€¢	Displays the title, date, explanation, and direct media link
Requirements
â€¢	Python 3.7+

â€¢	requests library
Install dependencies via:
pip install requests
Usage
1.	Clone or download this script.

2.	Open a terminal in the scriptâ€™s directory.

API Key
The script uses a demo NASA API key by default.
You can get your own API key from https://api.nasa.gov.
Limitations
â€¢	Dates before June 16, 1995 are not supported (APOD started then).

â€¢	Limited by NASA API rate limits (default key: 30 requests/hour).
Improvements in This Version
â€¢	Removed duplicate API calls â€” the script now calls the API only once per valid date.

â€¢	Removed redundant date checks â€” only one validation ensures the date is on/after June 16, 1995.

â€¢	Consolidated duplicate output blocks into a single, clean section.

â€¢	Simplified code flow for easier readability and maintenance.
